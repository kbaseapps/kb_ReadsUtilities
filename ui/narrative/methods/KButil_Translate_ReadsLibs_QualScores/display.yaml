    <p><b>Translate Reads Libraries’ Quality Scores</b> allows users to alter FASTQ single-end or paired-end reads libraries to use phred33 quality scores. For each input reads library that is translated, an output phred33 library object is created with the same name plus the extension '.phred33'.</p>

    <p>Phred33 is used for Sanger, 454, SRA, Illumina >= 1.8, so these files do not need to be converted to phred33. Illumina <= 1.7 is phred64, and often needs to be converted to phred33 to be processed correctly by modern bioinformatics tools.</p>
