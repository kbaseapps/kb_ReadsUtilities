    <p>This App allows the user to merge multiple Reads Libraries and/or Reads Sets into one Reads Library object. This can be necessary for certain Apps that cannot accept more than one reads library, such as for performing co-assemblies. This App does not account for repeat read IDs and will include duplicate reads from different libraries even if they possess identical IDs or sequence. Input reads libraries <u>must</u> all be either PairedEndLibraries or SingleEndLibraries (<u>but not both</u>) to allow for merging into a single output library type.</p>

    <p><h3>Configuration</h3></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Input reads libraries: Enter the Reads Libraries and/or ReadsSets that you want to combine into a single Reads Library object here. To add each library or set object, simply click the &quot;+&quot; button and select the library or set you wish to add. At a minimum, you must have at least two libraries or one set (containing two or more libraries). Every library in the input to merge must be of the same type, either all Paired-End or Single-End. It is left to the user to ensure that the sequencing type and protocol used in generating each input library is consistent, as this may affect the performance of Apps that use the merged library as input.</li>
      <li>Description: Describe the contents of the output combined Reads Library.</li>
      <li>Output reads library: The name of the output merged Reads Library object.</li>
      </ul>
      </p>
